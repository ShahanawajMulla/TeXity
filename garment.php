	<p>		        Sequence of Garments Manufacturing are given below in</p>
<p>details:</p>
<p>1. Design/ Sketch:</p>
<p>
In the garment manufacturing the first step is designing the sketch for the dresses that have to be
prepared. For this purpose the designer first draw several rough sketches in the sketch book. The
designer does not go for details at this moment but he rather let his creativity flow on the paper
and he draws many sketches. Later these sketches are analyzed by a panel of designers. They
finally select few out of them. These few sketches are rendered in detail separately or in the form
of a single collection. The designer also draws working drawings along with the sketch. Working
drawings are flat drawing of the sketch and it help pattern maker in understanding the patterns
involved in the construction.</p>

<p>2. Pattern Design:</p><p>
Hard paper copy of each component of the garment of exact dimension of each component is
called pattern. The patterns also include seam allowance, trimming allowance, dirts, and pleats,
ease allowance, any special design etc affairs. Pattern design could also be done manually or
with the help of computer.</p>
<p>
3. Sample Making:</p>
<p>The first patterns are sent to the sewing unit for assembling them into garment. This is usually
stitched on calico or muslin which is an inferior quality of fabric and it reduces cost. This sample
is constructed to analyze the pattern fit and design too. After the sample garment is stitched it is
reviewed by a panel of designers, pattern makers and sewing specialists. If any changes have to
be made they are made at this time.
</p><p>
4. Production Pattern:</p><p>
The pattern design is now taken for creating the production patterns. The production pattern is one
which will be used for huge production of garments. The pattern maker makes the patterns on
standard pattern making paper. These papers are made-up of various grades. The most important
component, the tissue paper pattern, is made from the lightest and thinnest paper commercially
available (it is not made at the pattern companies). It is called 7.5 lb (3.4 kg) basis paper,
meaning that a ream of it (500 sheets) only weighs 7.5 lb (3.4 kg).
Garment patterns can be constructed by two means: manual method, CAD/CAM method.
Today many companies have developed CAD/CAM because of the ease of designing patterns,
fluency and precision involved which cannot be guaranteed with the manual method. Investing
once into the CAD/CAM unit is worth in itself. Many buyers around the world prefer manufacturers
who are using CAD/CAM methods. The production patterns created in CAD/CAM can be stored
easily and they can be modified at any point of time.
A garment sewing pattern or garment fabric & patterns draft is developed by calculating, taking
account of the following measurements: -</p>
<p>1. Direct Sample.</p>
<p>2. Specification Sheet/ Measurement Chart.
</p><p>3. Actual body size measurements.
</p><p>4. Ease Allowances.
</p><p>5. Sewing Allowance.
</p><p>These allowances are different for different type of fabrics and patterns.
</p><p>5. Grading:
</p><p>The purpose of grading is to create patterns in different standard sizes. Grading a pattern is really
scaling a pattern up or down in order to adjust it for multiple sizes. Pattern sizes can be large,

medium and small or else there are standard patterns of size 10, 12, 14, 16 and so on for different
figure and statures sizes. This is generally how we get S M L XL XXL sizing. Pattern grading by
manual method is a cumbersome task because the grader has to alter the pattern on each and
every point from armhole, to neckline, sleeve cap and wrist etc. by using CAD it is much easier
and faster.
</p><p>6. Marker Making:
</p><p>All the pattern pieces for all the required sizes are arranged n the paper in such a way so that
maximum number of garments could be produced with minimum fabric wastag4e. Markers are
made for 6, 12, 18, 24 etc. pieces. Marker is also useful to estimate fabric consumption
calculations.
</p><p>7. Spreading:
</p><p>It is the process of arranging fabrics on the spreading table as per length and width of the marker
in stack form. Normally height of the lay/fabric is limited upto maximum six inches high. But 4
inch to 5 inch height of the lay is safe.
</p><p>8. Fabric Cutting:
</p><p>On the fabric lay/spread the marker paper is placed carefully and accurately, and pinned with the
fabric to avoid unwanted movement or displacement of the marker paper. Normally straight knife
cutting machine is used to cut out the garment component as per exact dimension of each
patterns in stack form, care must be taken to avoid cutting defects.
</p><p>9. Sorting/ Bundling:
</p><p>After cutting the entire fabric lay, all the garments components in stack form is shorted out as per
size and color. To avoid mistake in sorting, it is better to use code number on each pattern.
</p><p>10. Sewing or Assembling:
</p><p>It is the most important department/ section of a garment manufacturing industry. Sewing
machines of different types are arranged as a vertical line to assemble the garments. Sequence of
types of sewing machine arrangement depends on sequence of assembling operations. Number of
sewing machine per line varies from 20 nos to 60 nos depending on the style of the ga4rmnet to
be produce. Production pr line pr hour also varies from 100 to 150 pieces depending on specific

be produce. Production pr line pr hour also varies from 100 to 150 pieces depending on specific
circumstances. Number of sewing machine arrangement per line may be upto 60 depending on
design and out put quantity of garment.
</p><p>11. Inspection:
</p><p>Each and every garment after sewing passes through the inspection table/ point, where the
garments are thoroughly and carefully checked to detect/find any defect if present in the garment.
The defects may be for example variation of measurement, sewing defect, fabric defects, spots
etc. if the defect is possible to overcome, then the garment is sent to the respective person for
correction. If the defect is not correctionable, then the garment is separated as wastage.
</p><p>12. Pressing/ Finishing:
</p><p>After passing through the inspection table, each garment is normally ironed/ pressed to remove
unwanted crease and to improve the smoothness, so that the garments looks nice to the
customer. Folding of the garment is also done here for poly packing of the garments as per
required dimension.
</p><p>13. Final Inspection:
</p><p>It is the last stage of inspection f the manufactured garments on behalf of the garment
manufacturing organization, to detect any defective garments before packing.
</p><p>14. Packing:
</p><p>After final inspection, the garments are poly-packed, dozen-wise, color wise, size ratio wise,
bundled and packed in the cartoon. The cartoon is marked with important information in printed
form which is seen from outside the cartoon easily.
</p><p>15. Despatch:
</p><p>The cartoons of the manufactured garments are delivered or placed in the despatch department or
finished product godown, from where the garments lot is delivered for shipment.
