      <h1> About Ichalkaranji </h1>
	  
	  
	  
	  
	        The town is situated at an altitude of 556 meters above the mean sea level. The total area under jurisdiction of Municipal Council is 2752 hectare. Ichalkaranji is about 29 kms away to the South &ndash; East of Kolhapur and 26 kms. away to the South &ndash; West of Sangli. Three roads branching from Kolhapur to Sangli road enter the town, one from the North (Hatkanangle and Sangli sides). From the south it is accessible by road running from Nipani and Chikodi towns of Karnataka State. Hatakanagle, a Taluka Place is the nearest Railway station to Ichalkaranji situated towards North at a distance of 9.6 Km. by road. </p>
            <p>Ichalkaranji a town in Kolhapur District popularly known as &lsquo;Manchester of Maharashtra&rsquo; is one of the most prominent centers of decentralized textile industry of the country. Today there are over 70,000 power looms, around 35 power process houses and 70 hand process houses in and around this town. With the advent of about 35 new spinning mills this region has become a major centre for spinning mills. Many of these spinning mills are 100 % Export Oriented Units. Along with textile industry this town is also recognized for its co-operative movement. This is one of the few regions of the country where the co-operative movement has taken deep roots and has entered in almost every walk of the social life.</p>
              <p>The development of decentralized textile industry as well as the co-operative movement in this town has a long and interesting history. Ichalkaranji has been a small erstwhile princely state situated on the bank of river Panchaganga and was ruled by the Ghorpade dynasty for last two centuries. The chief of the state His Highness Shrimant Narayanrao Babasaheb Ghorpade was the main source of inspiration for the development of both the decentralized textile industry as well as the co-operative movement. He encouraged Mr. Vitthalrao Datar, a young entrepreneur of the town, to install a power loom in 1904. Perhaps this was the first power loom started in the decentralized textile industry of the country. Thus, Ichalkaranji has given a new concept and dimension to the Textile field of India. The foresighted Ruler gave a royal patronage by extending financial assistance as well as free land to the desirous weavers and other enterprising entrepreneurs. During his visit to Denmark and other western countries the Chief had an access to the co-operative sector of these countries and he was so much impressed with the success of the co-operative sector of these countries that on his return he vowed to exercise this movement for the benefit of his subjects. Thus the establishment of the Ichalkaranji Central Co-operative Bank, The Urban Co-operative Credit society and number of Credit societies in this state by His Highness reflects his vision. This movement helped the common man to stand on his feet. Through this movement His Highness created an atmosphere of trust and faith in the people. The further growth of Co-operative movement in this town finds its roots in his inspiration. The co-operative movement today not only provides financial assistance to the weavers, farmers &amp; other entrepreneurs but also helps in matters pertaining to marketing raw material supply as well as technical know-how. It is a matter of pride therefore for, citizens of Ichalkaranji to mention that, this small town has played an important role in spreading message of co-operative movement in Maharashtra.</p>
              <p>The dream of the ruler was to encourage industrialization of his state, which ultimately would lead to prosperity and elevating the standard of living of the common man. The decentralized power loom industry which was initiated at his instance grew by leaps and bounds. The success of his experiment spread to the other parts of the country and today the power loom industry has spread widely over the country with emergence of various centers viz, Bhivandi, Malegaon, Solapur &amp; Vita in Maharashtra, Surat in Gujarat, Erode, Karur, Salem in Tamilnadu, Pali, Balotra, Bhilwara in Rajasthan and recently, in the states of U.P. W Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka.</p>
              <p>Around 1945 there were approximately 1000 to 1500 power looms in the town. The numbers gradually increased to around 5000 in late fifties, with the increasing number of power looms, the owners started facing a problem of supply of yarn which is the major raw material for the industry. The power loom industry then, was dependent on yarn supply from Bombay and Other States. The regularity of supply and consistency of quality was not guaranteed. The leaders of the industry conceived the idea of having a co-operative spinning mill of the weavers of Ichalkaranji Late Shri. Abasaheb Kulkarni &amp; Late Shri Dattajirao Kadam pursued keenly the idea and then Chief Minister of Maharashtra Mr. Y.B. Chavan upheld the idea and extended all moral support and financial help. </p>
              <p>As a result of this in 1962 the Deccan Co-operative Spinning Mill came into existence which was the first of its kind in Asia.  Encouraged by success of the experiment a large number of spinning mills in co-operative sector have emerged all over the country, during last 36 years.</p>
              <p>Along with the power loom industry, the handloom industry also developed the flourished in this town during the World War-II period Ichalkaranji became well known for its handloom sarees. However after Sixties due to economical reasons the handloom industry was forced to a close. Up to 50 s the power loom industry used to sale grey fabric only. To add value to this product it was necessary to have a chemical processing unit. Again the veteran co-operators of this town came together to establish the first Process House in co-operative sector, the &ldquo;Lakshmi Co-operative Process Ltd&rdquo;. With increasing demand for processing another process known as &ldquo;Yashwant Co-operative Processors Ltd.&rdquo; was also established. As the Power loom industry was expanding at a rapid rate in 1980 s number of spinning mills in co-op. sector were registered. However, the Government of India put a ban on expansion of spindles in India in the 1980s and the progress of these registered spinning mills came to halt. Mr.K.B. Awade the then State Minister of Industries (M.S.) followed the idea of starting one of the registered co-operative spinning mills with World Bank finance, as indigenous finance was not available due to government policies. The Government of India permitted this mill to start on 100% export oriented basis and thus the first 100% E.O.U. in spinning in India the &ldquo;Nav Maharashtra Co-op.Spinning Mill&rdquo; came into existence in the co-op. sector.</p>
              <p>While the development of textile industry was taking place in and around Ichalkaranji, the industry started feeling the dearth of technical manpower. There was only one institute at Bombay catering to technical education in Textiles &amp; the students passing out from this Institute were not willing to come to the remote areas like Ichalkaranji. Various Co-operative organizations therefore, came together under the leadership of Mr. K.B. Awade and established a Technical Education Society, which was named after the great leader and veteran co-operator Mr. Dattajirao Kadam. The Dattajirao Kadam Technical Education Society as its first Endeavour started the &ldquo;Textile and Engineering Institute&rdquo; to cater to Diploma, Degree and Post Graduate level courses in textiles and other related areas.</p>
              <p>With the rapid progress of the industry, need for financial institutions was felt and this gave rise to a good member of co-operative banks in and around this town. To strengthen the network of financing the industry and to involve even the smallest of man from the society, Mr. Prakash Awade, the then State Minister of co-operation (M.S.) took a policy decision to encourage a large number of credit societies. Today there is a tremendous growth of Co-operative credit societies not only in and around Ichalkaranji but also all over the state. These credit societies can provide immediate finance to all its members without complicated formalities which has helped the society in to a great extent.</p>
              <p>Initially the development of the power loom industry was in the form of a home industry. However, as the number started increasing it was felt necessary to provide suitable premises with all essential facilities such as power, water etc. for the planned integrated development of this industry. This philosophy gave birth to co-operative industrial estates in and around the town mainly concentrating on the development of power loom and allied industries.</p>
              <p>In recent years there has been a growing awareness about the participation of women in various areas. Ichalkaranji has taken a step ahead in this regard also. Under the able leadership of Mr. K.B.Awade, Member of Parliament, the first co-operative spinning mill in India totally managed and run by ladies has been established and commissioned. This miss has been named after India&rsquo;s former Prime Minister as &ldquo;Indira Gandhi Mahila Sahakari Soot Girani Ltd&rdquo;.</p>
              <p>Thus Ichalkaranji a small town in the rural area of this western region of Maharashtra State, has given this nation many pioneering concepts which have not only provided new dimensions and direction to textile industry and co-operative movement of this country but also have initiated development of socio-economic as well as cultural status of the society in general. Due to such unparallel work put in by the sons of the soil, the District of Kolhapur assumes a place amongst the districts having highest per capita income in the country.            </p>
